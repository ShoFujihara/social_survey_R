\title{Weighted Percent Rank}
\usage{
prank(x, weights = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector of weights (same length as x). If NULL, equal weights are used.}

\item{na.rm}{Remove NA values (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector with values between 0 and 1
}
\description{
Calculate percent rank with survey weights.
Returns the weighted proportion of observations with values less than each value.
}
\examples{
x <- c(10, 20, 20, 30, 40)
w <- c(1, 2, 1, 3, 1)

# Weighted percent rank
prank(x, w)

# Without weights (equal weights)
prank(x)

# With dplyr
# ssm |> mutate(pinc_prank = prank(pinc, weight))
